# SoundEffects
This program is written by python during boring days of quarantine due to Corona virus.

In this application, you can add  mp3 files from your directory (which I strongly suggest you to visit https://www.myinstants.com/index/us/ to see these mp3 files) and after that you can pick a shortcuts for them.

from there on if you check Activate (or simply press F3 to do so), whenever you type those shortcuts everywhere (even if you minimize the application), your desired sound will be play.

this is useful in sending voice messages. while you are talking in the voice messages you can simply type those shortcuts and send them in the middle of your words.

for deactivating this feature you can uncheck the Activate or simply press F2 button.

BTW I've placed some sounds in "sounds" folder. so if you want to give it a try, you are free to go.
